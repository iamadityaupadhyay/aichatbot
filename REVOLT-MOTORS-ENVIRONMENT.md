# Revolt Motors Environment System

Revolutionary Electric Mobility Experience - Your custom environment mapping solution for Revolt Motors branding.

## What This Does

Instead of using generic environment files, this system creates a **custom Revolt Motors themed environment map** that reflects our revolutionary electric motorcycle brand and vision.

## Features

- üèçÔ∏è **Custom Revolt Motors Branding**: Environment features Revolt Motors colors and elements
- ‚ö° **Electric Theme**: Dynamic electric patterns and energy effects representing our EV technology
- üåÜ **Modern Urban Look**: Abstract patterns representing modern electric mobility
- üéØ **Brand Colors**: Uses Revolt Motors signature colors (black, red, white)
- üöÄ **Performance Optimized**: Generates textures programmatically for fast loading

## How It Works

### 1. Custom Environment Generator (`custom-environment.ts`)
- Creates a 2048x1024 canvas texture
- Applies Revolt Motors themed gradients and patterns
- Adds electric/energy visual effects representing our EV technology
- Includes subtle Revolt Motors branding elements

### 2. Integration (`visual-3d.ts`)
- Replaces the external environment loader with custom texture generation
- Creates proper Three.js environment mapping
- Maintains all the original 3D functionality

### 3. Generator Script (`generate-environment.ts`)
- Allows you to download your custom environment as a PNG file
- Provides blob URLs for dynamic usage
- Console functions for easy testing

## Usage

### In Development
The custom environment is automatically used when you run the application. No external files needed!

### Generate Custom Image File
```javascript
// In browser console:
generateRevoltMotorsEnvironment(); // Downloads revolt_motors_environment.png
```

### Modify the Environment
Edit `custom-environment.ts` to:
- Change colors and gradients to match new brand requirements
- Add different electric patterns
- Modify branding elements
- Adjust lighting effects for different moods

## Customization Options

### Colors
```typescript
// In custom-environment.ts, modify these color stops:
gradient.addColorStop(0, '#000000');   // Black top
gradient.addColorStop(0.4, '#333333'); // Medium gray  
gradient.addColorStop(0.7, '#cc0000'); // Revolt red
gradient.addColorStop(1, '#ff6666');   // Light red bottom
```

### Branding
```typescript
// Change the branding text:
this.ctx.fillText('REVOLT MOTORS', pos.x, pos.y);
```

### Patterns
- Modify `addElectricPattern()` for different energy effects representing EV technology
- Adjust `addEnvironmentalElements()` for different background shapes
- Update `addRevoltMotorsText()` for different text styling

2. **Full Control**: Modify every aspect of the environment to match brand evolution
3. **Brand Alignment**: Perfect match with Revolt Motors revolutionary theme
